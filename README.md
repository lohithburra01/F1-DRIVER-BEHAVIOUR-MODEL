# Formula 1 Driver Behavior Simulation

This Jupyter Notebook is part of a project aimed at simulating the driving behavior of Formula 1 drivers based on real telemetry data. The current focus is on analyzing and generating driving patterns of **Max Verstappen** during the **Monaco Grand Prix**. Future iterations of this project will include a broader set of drivers and circuits, creating a comprehensive library of driver behaviors across different race tracks.

## Project Objectives

- **Driver-Specific Simulation:**  
  Train machine learning models to replicate the unique driving style of specific F1 drivers.
  
- **Circuit-Specific Adaptation:**  
  Extend simulations to various Grand Prix circuits to understand how driving behavior changes with track characteristics.

- **Model Refinement:**  
  The current model requires further tweaking to enhance accuracy and realism in reproducing Verstappen's driving style.

## Current Status

- **Trained Model:**  
  - Focused solely on **Max Verstappen's Monaco GP** driving behavior.  
  - Further optimizations are needed to refine the predictions and improve fidelity.

- **Future Scope:**  
  - Expanding the dataset to include other circuits and drivers.  
  - Building a driver behavior library for various track conditions.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed to run the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
```

## Notebook Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling raw telemetry data and feature scaling.
   
2. **Model Definition & Training:**  
   - Building a PyTorch model to replicate driving behavior.  
   - Evaluating model accuracy using key performance metrics.

3. **Results & Visualization:**  
   - Analyzing the simulation outputs with plots and comparisons.
